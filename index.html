        <p>I don't really know what to write here so I'm just going to blither and blather until it
            looks somewhat like a paragraph of text. I saw a mouse running along the edge of the room
            and I'm wondering what it was eating in this building. I have nuts in my bag. Nuts and M&Ms.
            I don't usually eat M&Ms but I got a funsize bag from a Halloween party and it was my cheat
            weekend so I mixed it into my nut bag. It's like a trail mix now. I'm excited about snack time.
